## Research Interests
- Vehicle Routing Problem with uncertain travel time
- Artificial Intelligence for Transportation
- Large Scale Optimization
- Graphic Neural Network
- Statistical Modeling

## Projects
* **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Reinforcement Learning for Vehicle Routing with Routee Compass**
Applied PPO algorithms for vehicle routing with Routee Compass, optimizing cost efficiency by balancing time, distance, and energy. Achieved a 17% average reduction in operational costs by implementing these optimal routing policies.

* **Hierarchical Optimization Method (HOME) for eVTOL Network Design**
Initiated the design of a Hierarchical Optimization Method (HOME) for eVTOL network planning, combining integer linear programming with parallel computing. This method improved computational speed, reducing processing times from hours to minutes for complex network designs, and was validated through comparison with traditional methods in peer-reviewed forums.
